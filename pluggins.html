  <h1 class="title">---What is wordpress?---</h1>
  <p>WordPress is a free, open-source website creation platform. On a more technical level, WordPress is a content management system (CMS) written in PHP that uses a MySQL database. In non-geek speak, WordPress is the easiest and most powerful blogging and website builder in existence today.</p>

    <h2>What is a WordPress Website?</h2>
    <p>A WordPress website is any website that uses WordPress as its content management system (CMS). WordPress powers both the backend of the website (the interface where a user logs in to make changes or add new content) and the frontend (the visible part of the website that your visitors see on the web).</p>

  <div class="container-list">
    <ul>
        <p>Here are just a few examples of the types of websites you can build with WordPress:</p>
        <li><b>Bolg</b> – A blog is a special type of website devoted to sharing thoughts, photos, reviews, tutorials, recipes and so much more. Blogs usually display the most recently-published content first.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>E-commerce website </b> – An e-commerce website allows you to sell goods or services online and collect payment via an online payment system. You can download and install a WordPress e-commerce plugin to extend the default functionality of WordPress so you can have an online store on your website.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Business website</b>
       – Many businesses will benefit from having an online presence in the form of their own website. If your business needs a website for customers to learn about your company and what you have to offer, WordPress is an excellent option. Customers can contact you, ask for a quote, schedule an appointment and much more.  
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Membership website</b>
        – A membership website allows you to put content behind a paywall or an account login. To access pages or posts, users must login or pay for the content. WordPress can also handle membership websites with additional plugins.
      </li><br>
      <li><b>Portfolio website</b>
        – Show off your artwork, design skills and more with a portfolio website built on WordPress.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><b>Forum website</b>
        – A forum website can be a helpful place for users to ask questions or share advice. Believe it or not, many forum websites run on WordPress.

      <h2>Is WordPress right for me?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re wondering why WordPress is such a widely used website content management system, here are some of the benefits of WordPress as a website platform:
    </p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Simplicity:</b> WordPress allows you to publish and build your website content quickly. Even as a beginner, you can easily use WordPress.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <b>Flexibility:</b> WordPress allows you to create many types of websites from personal blogs and online stores to online magazines and newspapers.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <b>Easy to use </b> – If you can use a word processing software like Microsoft Word, you can use WordPress to build and manage a website.
      </li><br>
      <li>
        <b>No need to know code</b> – WordPress removes the requirement of needing to know how to code in order to build a website. While WordPress utilizes a variety of coding languages, there’s no need to know any of them to use WordPress.
